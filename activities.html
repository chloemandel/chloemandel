    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="description">I have been working at <a href="https://www.architecturaldesigns.com">Architectural Designs</a> since the summer following my sophomore year. I work two afternoons a week during the 
    school year and throughout my summer breaks. I use Photoshop to color floor plans and I regularly update the company's website with both
    text and images. Through this internship, I've had the opportunity to expand my computer skills through real world business applications.

    <h1 class="title">Today's Industrial Living Landscapes:</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 class="description">My sophomore English teacher recommended me for my internship at TILL, a non-profit focused on environmentally sustainable brownfield regeneration and technological advances within the Fairfield County community. For the past two years, I've worked
        with Fordham student Olivia Greenspan and New School professor
        <a href="http://janephilbrick.net">Jane Philbrick</a> to plan the regeneration and development of the Gilbert and Bennett Wire Mill, a former wire factory turned derelict brownfield site in Georgetown, CT. Our vision for the site includes a vertical
        farm, in which plants are grown vertically instead of horizontally to save land and preserve water. The plan also envisions a senior living center and a creative space for artists from nearby cities to work. Through my internship with TILL, I have also had the 
        opportunity to research the development and testing of autonomous vehicles in Connecticut. As a culmination of this research, I
         moderated a panel on the subject with my state senator Toni Boucher in attendance. Additionally, I was invited to speak at a community-wide event discussing sustainable textiles, and I pitched
        TILL's plan for the wire mill to local businesses.</h2>

    I decided to join the golf team in my sophomore year, as my grandparents and other extended family members are avid players and I had always wanted to learn.
    I have greatly improved my playing skills over the past few years, and have had lots of fun while doing so!</h2>

    This past year, the orchestra received a superior ranking at the Spirit of America Music Festival in Baltimore, Maryland. 
    I love playing violin, and I hope to continue playing in an orchestra in college.</h2>
