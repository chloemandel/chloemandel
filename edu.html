    <h2 class="description">While traveling in Europe during my freshman year, I attended school remotely, through an online high school program hosted by the University of Nebraska. Though the program did not offer any honors or AP classes, I found it challenging in that it had no deadlines
        for assignments, only an overarching deadline before which I would have to finish each class. Thus, I had to motivate myself each day to work on my assigned projects and study for assessments. Though I disliked the inability to talk to my teachers
        in person (I instead had to email them with questions, sometimes waiting weeks for a reply), I am grateful that the program gave me the opportunity to develop independent study skills I otherwise might not have gained.

    <h2 class="description">After returning from Europe in the spring of 2016, I began 10th grade at my current high school in Wilton, CT. Adjusting to a rigorous course 
    load after a year of online school felt difficult at first, but I soon adapted. It was great to have an open line 
    of communication with my teachers again, and to have access to all of the extracurricular activities WHS offers. Academically, I've
    chosen challenging and interesting classes; some of my favorites include Modern European Authors and Honors Physics.
